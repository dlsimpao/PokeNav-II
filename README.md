# PokeNav-II
Supplemental tool for Pokemon Emerald

#Aspects to Tackle Next:  

 - Conceptualize what aspects should a Pokedex entry contain  
 - Abilities, Stats, EVs, Catch Rate, Locations, Sprites? found***        
 
 - Expand locations to Gen 7, need to scrape from PokemonDB  ** [partially done, only locations, not areas]  

 - Figure out section for move tutors (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Move_Tutor#Free_Move_Tutors)  
 
 - Address Pokemon with different forms  (scrape, use keep(html_text(.) == "")) ***  
 - Learnset shown is only for the generation introduced, option for latest learnset? ***  
 -  Create section for Breeding Dex ***   

#Finished:

 - Generalize the Pokedex to cover available generations in PokeAPI (need gen 7, accomodate MissingNo, MalMetal) [done]  
 - Needs df of Pokemon Name and Generation introduced*** [done]  
 - Fix ItemDex descriptions [done]   

# Other Ideas  
 - Items for other generation games? (not priority)  
 - Expand to other Pokemon games like Insurgence, Reborn (Idea for new app)
