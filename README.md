# PokeNav-II
Supplemental tool for Pokemon Emerald

#Aspects to Tackle Next:  
1. Generalize the Pokedex to cover available generations in PokeAPI [need gen 7, accomodate MissingNo, MalMetal]
1b. Needs df of Pokemon Name and Generation introduced***    
2. Conceptualize what aspects should a Pokedex entry contain  
2b.Abilities, Stats, EVs, Catch Rate, Locations found***        
3. Items for other generation games? (not priority)  
4. Expand to other Pokemon games like Insurgence, Reborn (Maybe new App)*   
5. Expand locations to Gen 7, need to scrape from PokemonDB  **
