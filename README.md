# PokeNav-II
Supplemental tool for Pokemon Emerald

# Aspects to Tackle Next:  

 - Conceptualize what aspects should a Pokedex entry contain  
 - Basic Dex Entry, Abilities, Stats, EVs, Catch Rate, Locations, Sprites? partially done***        
 
 - Integrate different versions within a generation ***         
 
 - Expand locations to Gen 7, need to scrape from PokemonDB  ** [partially done, only locations, not areas]  

 - Figure out section for move tutors (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Move_Tutor#Free_Move_Tutors)  
 
 - Address Pokemon with different formes  (scraping) ***  
 
 - Test C++ alternative to better performance  
 - Find Pokemon not available in certain generations  

 - Figure out closing connections *

## Finished:

 - Generalize the Pokedex to cover available generations in PokeAPI (need gen 7, accomodate MissingNo, MalMetal) [done]  
 - Needs df of Pokemon Name and Generation introduced*** [done]  
 - Fix ItemDex descriptions [done]   
 - Learnset shown is only for the generation introduced, option for latest learnset? [done]
 - Fix romGen translations (easy) ****  
 - Test new learnset function to all Pokemon ****  

## Other Ideas  
 - Items for other generation games? (not priority)  
 - Expand to other Pokemon games like Insurgence, Reborn (Idea for new app)
